<h1>  MY CITY</h1>
<h2> GAYA JI</h2>
<img src="image.jpg.jpg">
<p>Gaya is the second largest city of Bihar, India, and it is also headquarter of Gaya District. Gaya is situated 100 km south of Patna, the capital city of Bihar. This ancient city grew on the banks of Phalgu River (Niranjana, as mentioned in Ramayana). This place is considered holy among the Hindus, the Buddhists and the Jains. It is surrounded by small rocky hills (Mangla-Gauri, Shringa-Sthan, Ram-Shila and Brahmayoni) by three sides and the river flowing on the fourth (eastern) side. Gaya derives its name from the mythological demon Gayasur (which literally means Gaya the demon).
Gaya, one of Bihar's most sacred cities, will now be officially known as 'Gaya Ji'. The name change honours the town's religious heritage and deep-rooted cultural sentiments.
Gaya is famous for its profound spiritual significance in both Hinduism and Buddhism, particularly as a major pilgrimage site. It's known for being the place where Lord Buddha attained enlightenment in Bodh Gaya, and for Hindus, Gaya is the location of the Pind Daan ritual, which is performed to honor and bring peace to the souls of ancestors.
